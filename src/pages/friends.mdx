# friends ðŸ’š

i love my friends. i believe my friends are incredibly cool people. i think you should take a look at them.

<div className="badge-grid">
  {friends.map((friend) => (
    <a href={friend.link} target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">
      <img
        alt={friend.name}
        src={`/static/img/88x31/${friend.image}`}
        width="88"
        height="31"
        className="badge"
      />
    </a>
  ))}
</div>

do you think you're cool enough to be on this list? or are we already friends and is this list clearly missing your amazing presence? [let me know](/contact)!
