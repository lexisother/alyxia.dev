hi! i'm **alyxia**! i'm a full stack developer based in your walls.

you can find me hanging around in various online communities you've never heard of, as well as on [github](https://github.com/lexisother) and [last.fm](https://last.fm/user/lexisother).

this website is very much a work in progress but you're free to browse around :)

<Status client:only="vue" />
<LastFM client:only="vue" />

<div hidden style={{ position: "fixed", top: "10000px" }}>
  {friends.map((friend) => (
    <a href={friend.link} target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        alt={friend.name}
        src={`/static/img/88x31/${friend.image}`}
        width="88"
        height="31"
      />
    </a>
  ))}
</div>
